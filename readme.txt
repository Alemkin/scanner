HW2 (Scanner)
Test Case 1 (Reused for ease of TA)

by Alexander Lemkin

This is a simple test case, with a very
basic PL/0 program. This program is 
grammatically correct, but this is not
a requirement for the scanner to work
correctly.

Just run gcc -o on on the c source code with an input.txt file in the same directory.
